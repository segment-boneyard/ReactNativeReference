## Setup

To recreate how this was app was setup, first follow the [React Native guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) to create your React Native app (do not use the Expo CLI as it doesn't native modules).

Then follow the [Segment React Native library guide](https://segment.com/docs/sources/mobile/react-native/#install-the-sdk) to install Segment. Be sure to setup [CocoaPods](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-react-native#setup-cocoapods-in-an-existing-project) first.
